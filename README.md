We faced some struggles with using loaded model in our web application. Model trained in runtime demonstrated great 
performance, but when we tried to save the model and load it in our web application, it showed terrible results.

Here are confusion matrices that demonstrate performance of two models:

  <summary>Model trained in runtime</summary>

</details>
<details open>
  <summary>Loaded model</summary>
    <ol>
    <img src="static/saved_model.png" alt="Loaded model">
    </ol>
</details>

**All attempts to load models are provided in [this file](attempts/attempts.py).**
